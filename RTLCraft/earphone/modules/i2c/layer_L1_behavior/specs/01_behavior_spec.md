## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
Functional model of I2C bus transactions (7-bit address, single-byte reads/writes).

### 1.2 Scope
Cycle-unaware functional behavior of EarphoneI2C.

## 2. Inputs from Previous Layer

See previous layer specification for inputs.

---

## 3. Outputs to Next Layer

See next layer specification for outputs.

---

## 4. Key Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----|----------|-----------|--------|
| DEC-01 | Implement EarphoneI2C as specified in top-level SoC spec | Matches target application and power/area constraints | Drives downstream implementation and verification |

---

## 5. Detailed Description

### Notes

- Status: implemented

### Detailed Table

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Address Width | 7 |
| Data Width | 8 |


---

## 6. Verification Considerations

### 6.1 Verification Strategy
Python unit tests against the functional reference model.

### 6.2 Key Verification Points
| ID | Check | Method | Coverage Goal |
|----|-------|--------|---------------|
| V-01 | Functional correctness of behavior model | Directed pytest cases | All operations and corner cases exercised |

---

## 7. Constraints and Assumptions

### 7.1 Constraints
| ID | Constraint | Source |
